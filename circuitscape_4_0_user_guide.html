<h1 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h1>
<p>Circuitscape is an open-source program that uses circuit theory to model 
connectivity in heterogeneous landscapes. Its most common applications include 
modeling movement and gene flow of plants and animals, as well as identifying 
areas important for connectivity conservation. Circuit theory complements 
commonly-used connectivity models because of its connections to random walk 
theory and its ability to simultaneously evaluate contributions of multiple 
dispersal pathways. Landscapes are represented as conductive surfaces, with 
low resistances assigned to landscape features types that are most permeable 
to movement or best promote gene flow, and high resistances assigned to 
movement barriers. Effective resistances, current flow, and voltages 
calculated across the landscapes can then be related to ecological processes, 
such as individual movement and gene flow. More detail about the underlying 
model, its parameterization, and potential applications in ecology, evolution, 
and conservation planning can be found in McRae (2006) and McRae et al. 
(2008). </p>
<p>Circuitscape was originally designed to analyze connectivity across raster 
grids. With version 4.0, it can now analyze arbitrary networks 
(graphs) with any set of connections between nodes the user specifies. 
Circuitscape can be run from a stand-alone interface or from an ArcGIS 
toolbox: </p>

</p> 

<p><strong>Fig. 2.</strong> ArcGIS Toolbox (for raster-based analyses only). The toolbox also 
includes utilities to put raster and feature class inputs into a common 
coordinate system. More utilities for creating core habitat areas and 
resistance layers are in development. </p>
<h3 id="before-you-start">Before You Start</h3>
<p>Whatever software you use, connectivity modeling involves a great deal of 
research, data compilation, GIS analyses, and careful interpretation of 
results. Defining areas to connect, parameterizing resistance models, and 
other modeling decisions you will need to make are not trivial. Before diving 
in, we strongly recommend that users first acquaint themselves with the 
process and challenges of connectivity modeling by consulting published 
resources. Good places to start include overviews on the <a href="https://www.corridordesign.org/">Corridor 
Design</a> and <a href="https://connectinglandscapes.org/">Connecting 
Landscapes</a> websites. Spear et al. (2010), 
Beier et al. (2011) and Zeller et al. (2012) offer helpful advice on 
resistance mapping and connectivity analysis in general. Before using this 
software, users should acquaint themselves with the use of circuit theory for 
modeling connectivity (summarized in McRae et al. 2008).</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://www.circuitscape.org/gnarly-landscape-utilities">Gnarly Landscape Utilities website</a> for tools that can help to automate resistance and core area modeling.  </p>
<p>Lastly, users interested in mapping important connectivity areas may wish to 
consider <a href="https://code.google.com/p/linkage-mapper/">Linkage Mapper</a>, which 
maps least-cost corridors. Linkage Mapper now also hybridizes least-cost 
corridor modeling with Circuitscape (see the Pinchpoint Mapper tool within the 
Linkage Mapper toolkit). Links to other connectivity tools can be found on the 
<a href="https://www.corridordesign.org/">Corridor Design</a> and <a href="http://connectinglandscapes.org/">Connecting 
Landscapes</a> websites. </p>
<h1 id="2-how-circuitscape-works">2. How Circuitscape Works</h1>
<p>Circuitscape may be called through its own graphical user interface, from the 
Circuitscape for ArcGIS Toolbox, or from the command line. Users supply 
Circuitscape with resistance data and the program calculates effective 
resistances and/or creates maps of current flow and voltages across landscapes 
and networks. </p>
<h3 id="two-data-types-network-and-raster">Two data types: network and raster</h3>
<p>Circuitscape reads either a network of nodes connected by links or a raster 
grid of resistances (Fig. 3). Links and raster cells are attributed with 
resistance values that reflect the degree to which the landscape facilitates 
or impedes movement. Networks and raster maps can be coded in resistances 
(with higher values denoting greater resistance to movement) or conductances 
(the reciprocal of resistance; higher values indicate greater ease of 
movement). </p>
<p align="center"> <img src="https://raw.github.com/Circuitscape/Circuitscape/master/docs/4.0/images/SimpleNetworkAndRaster.png" 
width="500px;"/> 
</p> 

<p><strong>Fig. 3.</strong> Simple illustrations of network and raster data types used by 
Circuitscape. The program can operate on networks of nodes (left panel) or 
raster grids (right panel). Raster grid cells can have any resistance value. 
Here, cells with zero resistance (&quot;short-circuit regions,&quot; which can be used 
to represent contiguous habitat patches) are shown in white, cells with a 
resistance of 1 are shown in gray, and a cell with infinite resistance (coded 
as NODATA) is shown in black. </p>
<p>For rasters, every grid cell with finite resistance is represented as a node 
in a graph, connected to either its four first-order or eight first- and 
second-order neighboring cells. Cells with infinite resistance (zero 
conductance) are dropped. Habitat patches, or collections of cells, can be 
assigned zero resistance (infinite conductance) using a separate 
&quot;short-circuit region&quot; file. These collections of cells are collapsed into a 
single node. </p>
<p align="center"> <img src ="https://raw.github.com/Circuitscape/Circuitscape/master/docs/4.0/images/RasterWithResistors.png" width="400px;"/> 
</p> 

<p><strong>Fig. 4.</strong> Raster grids are converted to electrical networks. Each cell 
becomes a node (represented by a dot), and adjacent cells are connected to 
their four or eight neighbors by resistors. Here, the two short-circuit 
regions have each been collapsed into a single node. The infinite resistance 
cell is dropped entirely from the network. </p>
<p><div style="page-break-after: always;"></div></p>
<h3 id="calculation-modes">Calculation modes</h3>
<p>Circuitscape operates in one of four modes: <strong>pairwise</strong>, <strong>advanced</strong>, 
<strong>one-to-all</strong>, and <strong>all-to-one</strong>. Pairwise and advanced modes are available 
for both raster and network data types. The one-to-all and all-to-one modes 
are available for raster data only. </p>
<p>In the <strong>pairwise</strong> mode, connectivity is calculated between all pairs of 
focal nodes (points or regions between which connectivity is to be modeled) 
supplied to the program in a single input file. For each pair of focal nodes, 
one node will arbitrarily be connected to a 1-amp current source, while the 
other will be connected to ground. Effective resistances will be calculated 
iteratively between all pairs of focal nodes, and, if selected, maps of 
current and voltage will be produced. If there are <em>n</em> focal nodes, there will 
be <em>n</em>(<em>n</em> - 1)/2 calculations <strong>unless</strong> you&#39;re using focal points (only one 
cell per focal node) and not mapping currents or voltages. In the latter case, 
we can do it in <em>n</em> calculations <strong>(much faster)</strong>. </p>
<p>The <strong>advanced</strong> mode offers much greater flexibility in defining sources and 
targets for current flow. The user defines any number of current sources and 
any number of grounds in a network or raster landscape, and these are all 
activated simultaneously. Sources represent points or areas from which current 
flows, whereas grounds represent nodes where current exits the system. </p>
<p>Source nodes can have different strengths (i.e. inject more or less current 
into the network or grid), and ground nodes can be tied to ground with any 
resistance. Current sources and grounds are supplied in separate input files. </p>
<p>Two other modes are available for raster data types only. The <strong>one-to-all 
</strong>mode is similar to the pairwise mode, and takes the same input files. 
However, instead of iterating across all focal node <em>pairs</em>, this mode 
iterates across all focal nodes. In each iteration, one focal node is 
connected to a 1-amp current source, while all remaining focal nodes are 
connected to ground. If there are <em>n</em> focal nodes, there will be <em>n</em> 
calculations. </p>
<p>The <strong>all-to-one </strong>mode is similar to the one-to-all mode, and takes the same 
input files. However, in this mode Circuitscape connects one focal node to 
ground and all remaining focal nodes to 1-amp current sources. It then repeats 
the process for each focal node; if there are <em>n</em> focal nodes, there will be 
<em>n</em> calculations. </p>
<p>Circuitscape can generate maps showing the current density and voltage at each 
node or cell under each configuration (and current flow for each link/resistor 
in networks). Additionally, Circuitscape writes a file reporting effective 
resistances between all pairs of focal nodes in the pairwise mode, and between 
each node and ground in the one-to-all mode. Resistances in the all-to-one 
mode are undefined, so a file is written with zeros indicating successful 
solves. </p>
<h3 id="illustrations-of-analyses-with-network-data">Illustrations of analyses with network data</h3>
<p>For network data types, any node can be connected to any other node by a 
resistor: </p>
<p align="center"> <img src="https://raw.github.com/Circuitscape/Circuitscape/master/docs/4.0/images/SimpleNetworkWithNumbers2.png" width=" 
400px;"/> 
</p> 

<p><strong>Fig. 5.</strong> Example network. This network would be input as a <strong>text list</strong> 
specifying resistances between each pair of connected nodes (0-1, 1-2, 1-3, 
2-3, and 2-4; see the <em>Input file formats</em> section below). </p>
<p>For <strong>pairwise analysis</strong> we would also supply a list of focal nodes 
(containing at least two node numbers, but as many as five, the number of 
nodes in the circuit) between which we want to perform calculations. </p>
<p align="center"> <img src="https://raw.github.com/Circuitscape/Circuitscape/master/docs/4.0/images/SimpleNetworkCurrentFlow.png" width=" 
400px;"/> 
</p> 

<p><strong>Fig 6.</strong> In pairwise mode, Circuitscape will iterate across pairs of nodes 
in a focal node list. If node 0 and node 4 are in the focal node list, then 
one of the iterations will look like the above, with a 1 amp current source 
connected to one node and the other grounded. Current will flow across the 
network from the source to the ground. Branch currents, node currents, node 
voltages, and effective resistances between node pairs can be written for each 
iteration. </p>
<p>More complexity can be added by running in <strong>advanced mode</strong>, which allows any 
number of sources and grounds to be activated simultaneously. For example, we 
could modify the circuit above by adding a single, fixed source at node zero 
and adding multiple grounds with different resistances. Current sources and 
grounds are entered in separate files. </p>

</p> 

<p><strong>Fig. 7.</strong> In advanced mode, any node can be tied to a current source or to 
ground, either directly or via resistors with any value (top panel). Currents 
passing through all nodes and links can then be calculated (bottom panel), and 
voltages can be calculated at each node. Circuit above is from McRae et al. 
(2008). </p>

</p> 

<p><strong>Fig. 8.</strong> Example raster input files for <strong>pairwise, one-to-all, and all-to-one modes</strong>. 
Input files in this example include a <strong>resistance map</strong> specifying per-cell 
resistances or conductances, a <strong>focal node location file</strong> (with two focal 
regions and one focal point in this case), and an optional <strong>short-circuit 
region map</strong>. Focal regions and short-circuit regions represent areas with 
zero resistance. Cells with the same region ID are considered perfectly 
connected and are collapsed into a single node, even if they are not 
contiguous. </p>

<p><strong>Fig. 9.</strong> Schematic describing <strong>pairwise</strong> mode analyses that would result 
from the input files shown in Fig. 8. Three sets of pairwise calculations,
involving focal nodes 1 and 2, nodes 1 and 3, and nodes 2 and 3, would be 
conducted. For each pair, one node would be connected to a 1-amp current 
source, and the other to ground. Note that focal region nodes become 
short-circuit regions when they are activated (e.g., node 1 in scenario 1), 
but these regions are not present when the nodes are not activated (e.g., node 
1 in scenario 3). </p>

<p><strong>Fig. 10.</strong> Schematic describing <strong>one-to-all mode</strong> analyses that would 
result from the input files shown in Fig. 8. Three sets of calculations, 
involving focal nodes 1, 2, and 3, would be conducted. For each, one node 
would be connected to a 1-amp current source, and the other two would be 
connected to ground. The all-to-one mode is similar, with arrow directions 
reversed; that is, one node is connected to ground while the remaining nodes 
are connected to 1-amp current sources. </p>

</p> 

<p><strong>Fig. 11.</strong> Example raster input files for <strong>advanced mode</strong>, which requires 
independent <strong>current source and ground files</strong>. Note that current sources in 
this example have different &quot;strengths,&quot; and ground nodes are connected to 
ground with differing levels of resistance. This example also includes an 
optional grid with five short-circuit regions. </p>

</p> 

<p><strong>Fig. 12.</strong> The first two panels show the &quot;effective&quot; configuration resulting 
from the input files in Fig. 11. Because current source C and grounds D and E 
overlap with short-circuit regions, these short-circuit regions effectively 
become sources or grounds themselves. The rightmost panel shows a schematic of 
the resulting analysis, with all sources (white points and polygons) and 
grounds (black points and polygons) activated simultaneously. Note that 
sources may be negative (drawing current out of the system), and ground nodes 
can actually contribute current to the system when negative sources are 
present. </p>

<p>Most users code their network or raster data in terms of resistances (with 
higher values denoting greater resistance to movement), which is common in 
connectivity modeling. Check this box if you want to specify 
conductances instead (conductance is the reciprocal of resistance; higher 
values indicate greater ease of movement). </p>
<p>Note that zero and infinite values for conductances and resistances represent 
special cases. Infinite resistances are coded as NODATA values (see file 
format description in the <em>Input file formats</em> section below) in input 
resistance grids, or as zero or NODATA in input conductance grids; these are 
treated as complete barriers, and are disconnected from all other cells. For 
raster analyses, cells with zero resistance (infinite conductance) can be 
specified using a separate short-circuit region file as described below. </p>

<h3 id="focal-node-location-and-data-type">Focal node location and data type</h3>
<p>This file specifies locations of nodes between which effective resistance and 
current flow are to be calculated (See Figs. 6 and 9). <strong>Each focal node 
should have a unique positive integer ID.</strong> Files may be text lists specifying 
coordinates or appropriate raster grid formats. When a grid is used, it must 
have the same cell size and extent as the resistance grid. The value stored in 
each grid cell location refers to the focal node ID. Cells that do not contain 
focal nodes should be coded with NODATA values. When a text list is used, the 
value field references the focal node ID. Examples are in the examples 
directory (located where Circuitscape is installed) and can also be found on 
the Circuitscape downloads page. </p>
<p>For raster analyses, focal nodes may occur at points (single cells on the 
resistance grid) or across regions (Fig. 8). For the latter, a single ID would 
occupymore than one cell in a grid or more than one pair of coordinates in a 
text list (and falling within more than one cell in the underlying resistance 
grid). Cells within a single region would then be collapsed into a single 
node, as they are when short-circuit region files are used (see below). The 
difference is that a focal region will be &quot;burned in&quot; to the resistance grid 
only for pairwise calculations that include that focal node. As with 
short-circuit regions, focal regions need not be made up of contiguous cells. 
For large grids or large numbers of focal nodes, focal regions may require 
more computation time. When calculating resistances on large raster grids and 
not creating voltage or current maps, focal points will run much more quickly. </p>
<h3 id="number-of-parallel-processors-to-use">Number of parallel processors to use</h3>
<p>On Mac OS X and Linux systems, Circuitscape can run iterations in parallel for
pairwise mode when focal points, not focal regions, are used. Choose how many 
processors you would like to devote to Circuitscape runs. </p>
<h2 id="advanced-mode-options">Advanced mode options</h2>
<h3 id="current-source-file">Current source file</h3>
<p>This file specifies locations and strengths, in amps, of current sources 
(Figs. 7 and 11). Either a raster or a text list may be used. Rasters must 
have the same cell size, projection, and extent as the resistance grid, and 
cells that do not contain current sources should be coded with NODATA values. 
Note: current sources may be positive or negative (i.e., they may inject 
current into the grid or pull current out. Similarly, grounds may either serve 
as a sink for current or may contribute current if there are negative current 
sources in the grid). Examples are in the examples directory. </p>
<h3 id="ground-point-file">Ground point file</h3>
<p>This file specifies locations of ground nodes and resistances or conductances 
of resistors tying them to ground (Figs. 7 and 11). Either a raster or a text 
list may be used. Rasters must have the same cell size, projection, and extent 
as the resistance grid, and cells that do not contain grounds should be coded 
with NODATA values. Note that if a direct (R = 0) ground connection conflicts 
with a current source, the ground will be removed unless the &#39;remove source&#39; 
option in the Options Window is chosen. Example ground input files are in the 
examples directory. </p>
<h3 id="data-represent-conductances-instead-of-resistances-to-ground">Data represent conductances instead of resistances to ground</h3>
<p>The default (unchecked) setting is to specify resistances to ground. Checking 
this box means that your ground point file specifies connections to ground in 
terms of conductance instead. To tie cells directly to ground, use resistances 
as the data type and set values in the corresponding ground point file to 
zero. </p>
<h2 id="output-options">Output options</h2>
<h3 id="base-output-filename">Base output filename</h3>
<p>Choose a directory path and base file name for output files. Resistances, 
current maps, voltage maps, and configuration files (which save user interface 
settings and have a .ini extension) will all use this base name, along with 
appropriate suffixes and extensions. </p>
<h3 id="create-current-maps">Create current maps</h3>
<p>When checked, current maps will be generated for every pair of focal nodes in 
the pairwise mode, or for the current source and ground configuration 
specified in the advanced mode. Current maps have the same dimension as the 
original input files, with values at each node (cell) representing the amount 
of current flowing through the node. In the pairwise mode, a current map file 
will be created for each focal node pair, and a cumulative (additive) file 
will be also written. (Note that for a given pair of focal nodes, current maps 
are identical regardless of which node is the source and which is the ground 
due to symmetry). For the advanced modeling mode, a single map will be written 
showing current densities at each cell resulting from the current source and 
ground configurations in the input files. These files can be displayed in a 
GIS as in Fig. 13. Such maps can be used to identify areas which contribute 
most to connectivity between focal points (McRae et al. 2008). </p>

Quantile classification schemes or &quot;histogram equalize&quot; stretches tend to work 
well for current maps when using ArcGIS. Research Collaborators: Brett Dickson 
and Rick Hopkins, Live Oak Associates. </p>
<h3 id="create-voltage-maps">Create voltage maps</h3>
<p>For the pairwise modeling mode, voltage maps give node voltages that would 
be observed for each focal node pair if one node were connected to a 1 amp 
current source and the other to ground. For the advanced modeling mode, 
voltage maps show voltages at each cell resulting from the current source 
and ground configurations in the input files. </p>

<h3 id="calculation-options">Calculation Options</h3>
<h4 id="connect-raster-cells-to-four-neighbors-instead-of-eight">Connect raster cells to FOUR neighbors instead of EIGHT</h4>
<p>For raster operations, Circuitscape creates a graph (network) by connecting 
cells to their four (Fig. 4) or eight immediate neighbors. The default is 
eight (four cardinal and four diagonal neighbors), but check this box if you 
want to connect cells to their four cardinal neighbors only. </p>
<h4 id="use-average-conductance-instead-of-resistance-for-connections-between-cells">Use average conductance instead of resistance for connections between cells</h4>
<p>For raster operations, this choice determines whether cells are connected by 
their average resistance or by their average conductance. Most users will want 
the default (unchecked). </p>
<p>The distinction is particularly important when connecting cells with zero or 
infinite values. When average resistances are used, first-order neighbors 
connected by resistors with resistance given by: <em>Rab</em> = (<em>Ra</em> + <em>Rb</em>) / 2, 
and second-order (diagonal) neighbors are connected by resistors with 
resistance given by: <em>Rab</em> = sqrt(2) * (<em>Ra</em> + <em>Rb</em>) / 2, where <em>Ra</em> and <em>Rb</em> are 
the resistances of the neighboring cells. When average conductances are used, 
first-order neighbors connected by resistors with conductance (the reciprocal 
of resistance) given by: <em>Gab</em> = (<em>Ga</em> + <em>Gb</em>) / 2, and second-order 
(diagonal) neighbors are connected by resistors with resistance given by: 
<em>Gab</em> = (<em>Ga</em> + <em>Gb</em>) / (2 * sqrt(2)), where <em>Ga</em> and <em>Gb</em> are the conductances of 
the neighboring cells. (As noted above, resistance and conductance are 
reciprocals of each other, i.e., <em>Gab</em> = 1 / <em>Rab</em>.) </p>
<h4 id="preemptively-release-memory-when-possible">Preemptively release memory when possible</h4>
<p>If you are getting memory errors this option may help to free some memory. It 
will likely result in slower execution times.</p>
<h4 id="pairwise-mode-run-in-low-memory-mode">Pairwise mode: Run in low memory mode</h4>
<p>For raster operations, this option will use less memory in the pairwise mode 
when focal points (not regions) are used, but will also run somewhat slower. </p>
<h4 id="advanced-mode-use-unit-currents-i-1-for-all-current-sources">Advanced mode: use unit currents (i=1) for all current sources</h4>
<p>All current sources will be set to 1 Amp, regardless of the value specified in 
the current source input file. </p>
<h4 id="advanced-mode-use-direct-connections-to-ground-r-0-for-all-ground-points">Advanced mode: use direct connections to ground (R=0) for all ground points</h4>
<p>All ground cells will be tied directly to ground, regardless of the value 
specified in the input ground file. </p>
<h4 id="advanced-mode-when-a-source-and-ground-are-at-the-same-node-">Advanced mode: when a source and ground are at the same node:</h4>
<p>Whenever a cell is connected both to a current source and to ground, this 
choice will determine whether the source is removed, the ground is removed, 
both are removed, or both are retained. For the latter, if a source is tied 
directly to ground (i.e., with zero resistance), the ground connection will be 
removed. </p>
<h3 id="mapping-options">Mapping Options</h3>
<h4 id="write-maximum-of-current-maps">Write maximum of current maps</h4>
<p>In pairwise, one-to-all, and all-to-one modes, current maps are created for 
every iteration. By default, Circuitscape will also write a cumulative map 
showing the sum of values at each node or grid cell across all iterations. If 
this option is checked, an an extra map that shows the maximum current value at 
each node or cell across iterations.  </p>
<h4 id="write-cumulative-max-current-maps-only">Write cumulative &amp; max current maps only</h4>
<p>Maps of current flow between each pair of focal nodes (or for each focal node 
in one-to-all and all-to-one modes) will be calculated, but only one summed 
map of current from all calculations (and a map of maximum values if that 
option is checked) will be written to disk. </p>
<h4 id="compress-output-grids">Compress output grids</h4>
<p>Output ASCII grids are automatically compressed using the gzip file format. 
This can be useful when many large maps will be written.</p>
<h4 id="log-transform-current-maps">Log-transform current maps</h4>
<p>Values in output current maps will reflect a log10 transform of current 
densities, which can be useful for visualizing them in some GIS packages (e.g.,
ArcView 3.X). Cells with zero current will be re-coded with NODATA values. </p>
<h4 id="set-focal-node-currents-to-zero">Set focal node currents to zero</h4>
<p>When running raster data in pairwise, all-to-one, and one-to all modes, focal
nodes will have zero current in output maps when they are activated. For 
pairwise mode, cumulative maps will still show currents flowing through focal 
regions that results from other pairs being activated. This helps to show 
current flowing through a focal region as it moves between other focal regions 
in cumulative current maps. This current passing through a focal region can 
give an idea of the importance of the focal region for connecting other focal 
region pairs (for an example, see Fig. 5 in Dickson et al. 2013).</p>
<h3 id="optional-input-files">Optional Input Files</h3>
<h4 id="read-raster-mask-file">Read raster mask file</h4>
<p>When checked, a dialog will open to select a raster mask file. Cells with 
negative, zero, or NODATA values in the mask will be dropped from the 
corresponding resistance map (i.e., treated as complete barriers). Positive 
integer cells will be retained. File should only contain integers and be in 
raster format. See example file &quot;mask.asc&quot; in the examples directory. </p>
<h4 id="load-a-raster-short-circuit-region-map">Load a raster short-circuit region map</h4>
<p>Short-circuit regions act as areas of 
zero resistance, essentially providing patches through which current is given a 
&quot;free ride&quot; as it flows across the landscape. Each short-circuit region should 
have a unique positive integer identifier; cells within each region are merged 
into a single node with all other cells in the region, including non-adjacent 
cells (i.e., regions need not be contiguous). Non-short-circuit-region areas 
should be stored as NODATA values. The file must have the same cell size and 
extent as the resistance grid. </p>
<h4 id="one-to-all-and-all-to-one-modes-read-source-strength-file">One-to-all and All-to-One modes: Read source strength file</h4>
<p>When checked, a dialog will open to select a text list of focal node IDs and 
corresponding source strengths. For any focal node in this list, the amount of 
current injected into that node when it is a source node will be set to the 
strength specified in the list. All nodes not in the list will default to 1 
Amp. This should be in the same file format as the Text List File Format given 
below, but with two columns (ID followed by source strength). File should have 
a .txt extension. See example file &quot;source_strength_list.txt&quot; in the examples 
directory. </p>
<h4 id="read-file-with-focal-node-pairs-to-include-exclude">Read file with focal node pairs to include/exclude</h4>
<p>This option allows users to only perform calculations on a subset of focal node
pairs. Users can either identify pairs to include in calculations, or pairs to 
exclude, as specified in the first line of the file.</p>
<p>This affects all modes except the Advanced Mode.  Files should be in 
tab-delimited text with a .txt extension. See formatting information in the 
<em>Input file formats</em> section below.</p>
<h3 id="the-log-window">The Log Window</h3>

<h1 id="5-using-the-circuitscape-for-arcgis-toolbox-windows-only-">5. Using the Circuitscape for ArcGIS Toolbox (Windows only)</h1>
<p>The ArcGIS toolbox can facilitate raster Circuitscape analyses. It allows you 
to run Circuitscape from ArcMap or ArcCatalog, using ESRI grids or raster file 
geodatabases as inputs (no need to export to ASCII). Toolbox options 
correspond to those in the stand-alone user interface described above. The 
toolbox also has utilities to convert shapefiles and feature classes to raster 
focal node files. You must have the Circuitscape executable installed to use 
the toolbox. </p>
<h1 id="6-running-circuitscape-from-the-command-line">6. Running Circuitscape from the command line</h1>
<p>On Linux machines, Circuitscape is run from the command line. On other platforms,
running from the command line is useful when calling different Circuitscape from
scripts (e.g., written in Python or R) or external programs. </p>
<p>Whether Circuitscape is called from 
the command line or the graphical user interface, settings (such as input file 
names) are passed to the main Circuitscape module using a configuration file. 
The configuration file has a .ini extension, and can be created and saved from 
the user interface. The file may also be edited directly in a standard text 
editor. We don&#39;t yet have documentation for each of the settings, but if you 
save some different configurations from the user interface and edit the 
resulting .ini files, you can quickly get the hang of which options correspond 
to which settings in the interface. </p>
<p>To call Circuitscape from the command line in Linux, use the command </p>
<pre><code>python csrun.py [config file]</code></pre>
<p>where <code>[config file]</code> is the name (and path, if the 
file is in a different directory) of the configuration (.ini) file. </p>
<p>On Windows machines, the command-line executable can be called using the 
command:</p>
<pre><code>cs_run.exe [config file]</code></pre>
<p>where <code>[config file]</code> is the name (and path, if the file is in a different 
directory) of the configuration file. You will need to call Circuitscape from
the installation directory (e.g., <code>C:\Program Files\Circuitscape\</code>), or 
provide the full path to <code>cs_run.exe</code>.</p>
<h1 id="7-calling-circuitscape-from-other-programs">7. Calling Circuitscape from other programs</h1>
<p>Circuitscape can be invoked from external programs and scripts (e.g., Python 
and R) to do computations on 
rasters and networks and return results. It reads user settings from a 
configuration (.ini) file that can be either created manually or saved from 
the user interface (under File &gt;&gt; Save settings). </p>
<p>If the external program can interface with Python packages, then the 
Circuitscape methods can be called directly when Circuitscape is installed as 
a Python package. For example: </p>
<pre><code>from circuitscape import Compute

cs = Compute(&#39;configuration.ini&#39;, &#39;Screen&#39;)
result = cs.compute()</code></pre>
<p>If such direct interfacing with Python packages is not possible, Circuitscape 
can be invoked as an application with the following command: </p>
<pre><code>python csrun.py [configuration.ini]</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, the cs_run.exe executable can be invoked from external programs 
and scripts on Windows. Linkage Mapper calls Circuitscape this way from the 
Pinchpoint and Centrality modules, as does the Circuitscape for ArcGIS toolbox. </p>
<p>In the cases above, results are written out to files which are then read back
by the external program. </p>
<h1 id="8-input-file-formats">8. Input file formats</h1>
<p>When working with networks, text lists are used for all input files. </p>
<p>For raster analyses using the ArcGIS toolbox, resistance grids and other 
inputs can be in a number of raster formats. For raster analyses using the 
stand-alone Circuitscape interface (Fig. 1) or calling Circuitscape from the 
command line or from other programs, resistance grids should be in ASCII 
raster format, and focal node, current source, and ground files can be in 
either raster or text list format. </p>
<h2 id="esri-raster-formats-when-using-the-circuitscape-for-arcgis-toolbox-">ESRI Raster formats (when using the Circuitscape for ArcGIS Toolbox)</h2>
<p>When using the Circuitscape for ArcGIS Toolbox, you can use ESRI grids, raster 
file geodatabases, ASCII rasters, and other raster formats supported by 
ArcGIS. It&#39;s a good idea to have your input files in the same projection. The 
toolbox includes a utility to convert vector focal node files to raster, and 
to put all input files in one projection with the same raster extent. </p>
<h2 id="ascii-raster-format-when-using-standalone-user-interface-or-calling-directly-">ASCII raster format (when using standalone user interface or calling directly).</h2>
<p>When using the stand-alone Circuitscape interface, raster input maps should be 
stored in Arc/Info ASCII grid format, as exported by standard GIS packages 
(see examples in examples directory; these may be viewed with standard text 
editors). For focal nodes, the value stored in each grid location refers to 
the focal node ID, and a single ID can occupy more than one cell (IDs must be 
positive integers). For current sources, the grid value specifies the source 
strength in amps. For grounds, the grid value specifies either the resistance 
or conductance of the resistor tying each ground node to ground, as specified 
in the Options window. </p>
<p>The ASCII raster format is as follows: </p>
<p><strong>Header:</strong></p>

<p>Note that regions 1 and 2 are well-connected by a low-resistance corridor in
the resistance map above.  Region 3 is connected to the other two regions only 
if cells are connected to their eight neighbors. In the four-neighbor case, 
region 3 would be completely isolated.</p>
<h2 id="text-list-file-format">Text list file format</h2>
<p>For network/graph operations, resistor networks, focal nodes, current sources, 
and grounds should be stored as text lists (saved with a &quot;.txt&quot; extension). To 
specify a network of resistors, three columns are used. The first and second 
columns give the node IDs being connected by a resistor, and the third column 
gives the resistance value. For example, the simple circuit: </p>
<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.github.com/Circuitscape/Circuitscape/master/docs/4.0/images/SimpleNetworkWithNumbers2.png" width=" 400px;"/> 
</p>  

<p>can be defined by the following text list:</p>
<pre><code>    0    1    1
    1    2    1
    1    3    1
    2    4    1
    3    4    1</code></pre>
<p>This file can be found in the examples directory (network_graph.txt). <strong>Please note:</strong> typically, there should just be one entry for each pair of connected nodes. If there are two entries for a single pair in the form of (node1, node2, value1) and (node2, node1, value2), these will be considered parallel resistors and their conductances will be summed. For example, if the above text list had an extra entry for node pair (4, 3) like this:</p>
<pre><code>    0    1    1
    1    2    1
    1    3    1
    2    4    1
    3    4    1
    4    3    1</code></pre>
<p>then the resistance between nodes 3 and 4 in the resulting graph would be 1/2 ohm.  </p>
<p>For advanced mode, current sources and grounds are also stored as text lists. 
The above circuit can be expanded to include a current source and grounds with 
two extra input files. For example, we can add a 1 Amp current source at node 
0 with a file that looks like this: </p>
<pre><code>    0    1</code></pre>
<p>To tie node 4 directly to ground (i.e. to connect it to ground with a wire 
that has a resistance of 0 Ohms) and connect the remaining nodes to ground 
with resistors, we can use a file that looks like this: </p>
<pre><code>    0    99
    1    33
    2    49.5
    3    49.5
    4    0</code></pre>
<p>These files are also included in the examples directory. The resulting circuit 
would look like this (from McRae et al. 2008):</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.github.com/Circuitscape/Circuitscape/master/docs/4.0/images/AdvancedNetwork.png" width="500px;"/> 
</p>  

<p>For <strong>raster</strong> operations, you can also store focal nodes, current sources, 
and grounds as text lists (saved with a &quot;.txt&quot; extension). For each node 
referenced in a text list, a value and X and Y coordinates are specified as 
shown below. </p>
<pre><code>    Value1 X1 Y1
    Value2 X2 Y2
    …</code></pre>
<p>Note: X and Y are geographical coordinates, not row and column numbers.</p>
<p>Example text list (a partial list of the cell locations in the focal region
map above; coordinates are for cell centroids):</p>
<pre><code>    1    2.5    9.5
    1    3.5    9.5
    1    2.5    8.5
    1    3.5    8.5
    1    2.5    7.5  
    1    3.5    7.5
    1    2.5    5.5
    2    6.5    4.5
    ...</code></pre>
<p>For focal nodes, the value field references the focal node ID; values must be 
positive integers, and a single ID can occupy more than one pair of coordinates 
(and more than one cell in the underlying resistance grid). For current 
sources, the value field references the source strength in amps. For grounds, 
the value field references either the resistance or conductance of the resistor 
tying each ground node to ground, as set in the Options window.</p>
<h2 id="include-exclude-file-format">Include/exclude file format</h2>
<p>This file will be loaded when the &#39;Read file with focal node pairs to 
include/exclude&#39; option is checked, and affects all modes except the advanced 
mode. There are two file formats that can be 
used. The first is the simplest, and gives a list of pairs to include
in calculations, or pairs to exclude, as specified in the first line of the 
file. For example, if there are  five focal nodes, numbered 1-5, and the 
following list is entered, only pairs (1,2), (1,3), and (1,5) will be analyzed:</p>
<pre><code>mode    include
1        2
1        3
1        5</code></pre>
<p>Similarly, if the first line in the above file read:</p>
<pre><code>mode     exclude</code></pre>
<p>all pairs except (1,2), (1,3), and (1,5) would be analyzed. See example file 
&quot;list_of_pairs_to_include.txt&quot; in the examples directory.</p>
<p>The second method uses a matrix identifying which pairs of focal nodes to 
connect.  The file specifies minimum and maximum values in the matrix to 
consider a pair connected.  This method can be useful when used with a distance 
matrix to only run analyses between points separated by a minimum distance, or 
by a distance equal to or less than a maximum distance.  Note: any focal node 
not in the matrix will be dropped from analyses.  Entries on the diagonal are 
ignored.  For example, in the following matrix, only pairs with entries between 
2 and 50 are connected.  Pairs (1,2), (2,4), and (3,4) will not be analyzed.<br>Focal node 5 will be dropped entirely: </p>
<pre><code>min    2
max    50
0     1     2     3     4     5    
1     0     100   6.67  7     1    
2     100   0     11    1     60
3     6.67  11    0     -1    100    
4     7     1     -1    0     0
5     1     60     100  0     0</code></pre>
<p>Make sure to include a zero in the upper-left corner of the matrix.</p>
<p>Files should be in tab-delimited text with a .txt extension. See example file “matrix_of_pairs_to_include_and_exclude.txt” in the examples directory.</p>
<h1 id="9-output-files">9. Output files</h1>
<h2 id="current-and-voltage-data">Current and voltage data</h2>
<p>Current and voltage data for networks will be written in text list formats.</p>
<p>When using the ArcGIS toolbox, current and voltage maps will be written in the
raster format chosen by the user. </p>
<p>When not using the ArcGIS toolbox, raster voltage and current maps are written
using the ASCII raster format described above.</p>
<h2 id="resistance-files">Resistance files</h2>
<p>Resistance data are written in both matrix and 3-column formats.</p>
<p>Here are pairwise resistances written to the output directory for the eight
neighbor case (using per-cell resistances and average resistances for cell
connection calculations; this can be replicated by loading
eight_neighbor_example.ini from the examples directory).  The first row and
column contain the focal node IDs:</p>
<pre><code>  0          1            2            3  
  1          0            11.93688471  15.03634473
  2          11.93688471  0            11.57640568
  3          15.03634473  11.57640568  0</code></pre>
<p>Here are pairwise resistances written to the output directory for the four
neighbor case, in which focal node 3 was completely isolated (-1 indicates
infinite resistance):</p>
<pre><code>  0          1            2            3  
  1          0            33.55792693  -1
  2          33.55792693  0            -1
  3          -1           -1           0</code></pre>
<p>For convenience, resistances are also written to a separate file in a 3-column
format, e.g.:</p>
<pre><code>  1      2       33.55792693           
  1      3       -1
  2      3       -1</code></pre>
<h1 id="10-computational-limitations-speed-and-landscape-size">10. Computational limitations, speed, and landscape size</h1>
<p>We have tested this code on landscapes with up to 100 million cells.
Increasing numbers of connections using diagonal (eight neighbor) connections
will decrease the size of landscapes that can be analyzed.  Also, increasing
landscape size or numbers of focal nodes will increase computation time.  We
anticipate future improvements will increase the program&#39;s speed.  Note that
due to the matrix algebra involved with solving many pairs of focal nodes,
Circuitscape will run much faster when focal points (each focal node falls 
within only one grid cell), rather than focal regions (at least one focal node 
occupies multiple grid cells), are used.</p>
<h2 id="important-note-memory-limitations">Important note: memory limitations</h2>
<p>Insufficient RAM is the most common cause of program errors.  32-bit systems
will be particularly limited because no more than 2GB of memory can be
addressed by any one process, limiting solvable landscapes to approximately
2-6 million cells, depending on the properties of the grid.  Larger grids can
be solved on 64-bit systems with large amounts of RAM.</p>
<p>There are several ways to increase the solvable grid size. These include 
closing all other programs (especially those that require lots of RAM such as 
ArcGIS), setting impermeable areas of your resistance map to NODATA, using 
focal points instead of regions in pairwise mode, connecting cells to their 
four neighbors only, and not creating current maps. Also, the one-to-all and 
all- to-one modes typically use less memory (and run more quickly) than the 
pairwise mode. In particular, the all-to-one mode can be an alternative to the 
pairwise mode when the goal is to produce a cumulative map of important 
connectivity areas among multiple source/target patches. Still, coarsening 
your grids (using larger cell sizes) may be necessary; doing so often produces 
results that are qualitatively similar to those obtained with smaller cell 
sizes. See McRae et al. 2008 for details of effects of using coarser grids. </p>
